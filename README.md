# LIPS
Final project for Machine Learning at Boston University

To send changes to the cluster and test:
```
# local
scp src/* jcmerf@scc1.bu.edu:/projectnb/cs542sp/jcmerf/src/

# on cluster
bash pipeline.sh [NUMBER_OF_FILES_TO_USE]

# analysis scripts to come!

```

Presentation flow:
1. What is lip reading?
2. Where did the data come from?
3. What do the data look like?
4. How did we process the data?
5. How did we train the model?
6. What are our results?


```
scp -r jcmerf@scc1.bu.edu:/projectnb/cs542sp/ainezm/mvlrs_v1/pretrain/5555* .
```
